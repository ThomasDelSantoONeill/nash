Description: An algorithm that computes harvesting rates at the Nash
    Equilibrium when exploiting natural interdependent resources. The
    user provides a model describing the ecosystem through a function that
    returns long-term yields as output. Such function will be then utilise as 
    input by the `nash` function.
    The package contains a second function `fn_rpath` that can be specifically 
    used for Ecopaht with Ecosim (EwE) models, formulated via its R 
    implementation `Rpath`, so as to streamline its usage.
