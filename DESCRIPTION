Description: An algorithm that computes harvesting rates at the Nash
    Equilibrium when exploiting natural interdependent resources. The
    user provides a model describing the system through a function that
    returns long-term yields and calls the `nash` function that handles
    the subtleties. Furthermore, the package contains a second function
    `fn_rpath` that streamlines the aforementioned specifically for 
    Ecopaht with Ecosim models formulated via its R implementation 
    `Rpath`.
